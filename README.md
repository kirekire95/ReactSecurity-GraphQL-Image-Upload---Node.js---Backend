### Notes

- Everything seems to be working pretty well. We have some authorization going on, but if you are logged in, you can delete, view, and edit anyones stuff which is not ideal. Fix later.

### Todo

- Add image upload
- Look into graphql shield or other schema auth directives for ReactSecurity Node.js Backend
