### Notes

- Everything seems to be working pretty well. We have some authorization going on, but if you are logged in, you can delete, view, and edit anyones stuff which is not ideal. Fix later.

### Todo

- Removed image upload - it has too many issues with its packages, and potential issues with type module for imports as well
- Look into graphql shield or other schema auth directives for ReactSecurity Node.js Backend
- Should not be able to edit its own username/email to be something that already exists
